"Illustration with letter 'T'" border="0" align="left"></a> his
nice little French drama has now been running at the FIFTH AVENUE
THEATRE more than seven weeks. It is the story of a man who
killed the seducer of his wife, and then forgave and received
back again the guilty woman.</p>

<p>The same tragic farce was played in Washington some eleven
years ago. The actor who played the part of the outraged husband
made an effective hit at the time, but he has never repeated the
performance. Since then he has become a double-star actor in a
wider field, There are those who insist that he is an ill-starred
actor in a general way; but as he has left the country, we can
leave those who regard his absence as a good riddance of bad
rubbish, and those who call it a Madriddance of good rubbish, to
discuss his merits at their leisure.</p>

<p>After the execution of unnecessary quantities of noisy
overture by the orchestra, the play begins. Soon after, the
audience arrives. It is a rule with our play-goers never to see
the first scene of any drama. This rule originates in a
benevolent wish to permit the actors to slide gradually into a
consciousness that somebody is looking at them; thus saving them
from the possibility of stage-fright. Simple folks, who do not
understand the meaning of the custom, erroneously regard it as an
evidence of vulgarity and discourtesy.</p>

<p>The first act is not exciting. Mr. G.H. CLARKE, in
irreproachable clothes, (the clothes of this actor's professional
life become him, if any thing, better than his acting,) offers
his hand to FROU-FROU, a small girl with a reckless display of
back-hair, and is accepted, to the evident disgust of her
sensible sister, LOUISE.</p>

<p><i>Sympathetic Young Lady who adores that dear Mr.
Clarke.</i>&mdash;"How sweetly pretty! Do the people on the stage talk
just like the <i>real</i> French aristocracy?"</p>

<p><i>Travelled friend, knowing that persons in the neighborhood
are listening for his reply</i>&mdash;"Well, yes. To a certain extent,
that is." (<i>It suddenly occurring to him that nobody can know
any thing about the Legitimists, he says confidently</i>.) "They
haven't the air, you know, of the genuine old Legitimist
<i>noblesse</i>. As to BONAPARTE'S nobility, I don't know much
about them."</p>

<p><i>He flatters himself that he has said a neat thing, but is
posed by an unexpected question from the Sympathetic Young Lady,
who asks&mdash;</i>"Who are the great Legitimist families,
nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Well, the&mdash;the&mdash;<i>(can't think of any name but St. Germain,
and so says boldly,)</i> the St. Germains, and all the rest of
'em, you know." (<i>He is sorely tempted to add the St. Clouds
and the Luxembourgs, but prudently refrains</i>.)</p>

<p>The second act shows the husband lavishing every sort of
tenderness and jewelry upon the wife, who is developing a strong
tendency to flirt. She insists that her sister LOUISE shall join
the family and accept the position of Acting Assistant Wife and
Mother, while she herself gives her whole mind to innocent
flirtation.</p>

<p><i>Worldly-wise Matron of evident experience</i>&mdash;"The girl's
a fool. Catch me taking a pretty sister into my house!"</p>

<p><i>Brutal Husband of the Matron suggests</i>&mdash;"But she might
have done so much worse, my dear. Suppose she had given her
husband a mother-in-law as a housekeeper?"</p>

<p><i>Matron, with suppressed fury</i>&mdash;"Very well, my dear. If
you can't refrain from insulting dear mother, I shall leave you
to sit out the play alone."</p>

<p>(<i>Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh! from every body. Curtain rises again</i>.)
More attentions to pretty wife, repaid by more flirtation at her
husband's expense. Finally FROU-FROU decides that LOUISE manages
the household so admirably that misery must be the result. As a
necessary consequence of this logical conclusion, she rushes out
of the house with a gesture borrowed from RIP VAN WINKLE, and an
expressed determination to elope.</p>

<p><i>Jocular Man remarks</i>&mdash;"Now, then, CLARKE can go to
Chicago, get a divorce, and marry LOUISE."</p>

<p><i>This practical suggestion is warmly reprobated by the
ladies who overhear it, one of whom remarks with withering
scorn</i>&mdash;"Some people think it <i>so</i> smart to ridicule
every thing. To my mind there is nothing more vulgar."</p>

<p><i>The Jocular Man, refusing to be withered, assures the
Travelled Man confidentially that</i>&mdash;"The play is frightful
trash, and as for the acting, why, your little milliner in the
Rue de la Paix could give MISS ETHEL any odds you please.
"(<i>Both look as though they remembered some delightfully
improper Parisian dissipation, and in consequence rise rapidly in
the estimation of the respectable ladies who are within
hearing</i>.)</p>

<p>After the orchestra has given specimens of every modern
composer, the fourth act begins. FROU-FROU is found living at
Venice with her lover. Her husband surprises her. He is pale and
weak; but, returning her the amount of her dower, goes out to
shoot the lover.</p>

<p><i>Rural Person announces as a startling
discovery</i>&mdash;"That's Miss AGNES ETHEL who's a-playin'
FROW-FROW. Well, now, she ain't nothin' to LYDDY THOMPSON."</p>

<p><i>Jocular Man says to his Travelled Friend</i>&mdash;"The idea of
Miss ETHEL trying to act like a French-woman! Did you hear how
she pronounced <i>Monsieur</i>?"</p>

<p><i>Travelled Man smiles weakly, conscious of the imperfections
of his own pronunciation. To his dismay, the Sympathetic Young
Lady asks</i>&mdash;"What does that horrid man mean? How do you
pronounce the word he talks about?"</p>

<p><i>Travelled Man, with desperation</i>&mdash;"It ought to be
pronounced m&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;" (<i>ending in an inaudible murmur</i>.)</p>

<p>"What? I didn't quite hear."</p>

<p><i>The Travelled Man will catch at a straw. He does so, and
says</i>&mdash;"Excuse me, but the curtain is rising."</p>

<p>FROU-FROU, in a dying state and a black dress, with her
back-hair neatly arranged, is brought into her husband's house to
die. He kneels at her feet. "You must not die. I am alone at
fault. Forgive me sweet angel, and live." With the only gleam of
good sense which she has yet shown, FROU-FROU refuses to live,
and dropping her head heavily on the arm of the sofa, with a
blind confidence that the thickness of her chignon will save her
from a fractured skull, she peremptorily dies.</p>

<p><i>Subdued sobs from the audience, with the single exception
of the Jocular Man, who says</i>&mdash;"Well, if that's moral, I don't
know what's immoral; and I did think I had lived long enough in
Paris to know that."</p>

<p>With which opinion we heartily coincide, adding also the
seriously critical remark that though Messrs. DAVIDGE and LEWIS
play their comic parts with honest excellence, and though Mr.
CLARKE is really a good actor in spite of his popularity with the
ladies of the audience, Miss ETHEL, upon whom the whole play
depends, is so obviously incompetent to personate a brilliant and
<i>spirituelle</i> Parisienne that one wonders at the popularity
of FROU-FROU. The majority of the audience are ladies. Can it be
that they like the play because it teaches that the sins of a
pretty woman should be condoned by her husband, provided she
looks well with her back-hair down?</p>

<h3>PUNCHINELLO AND THE ALDERMEN.</h3>
</div>

<p>The City Aldermen have called in a body to pay their respects
to PUNCHINELLO. PUNCHINELLO has not returned the compliment,
since he likes neither their looks, their diamonds, or their
diamond-cut-diamond ways. They curb streets by resolution, but
they have not resolution enough to keep the streets from curbing
them. They gutter highways, but oftenest let Low Ways gutter
them. They wear fine shirt-fronts, but resort to sorry and
disreputable shifts in order to procure them. They are gorgeously
and gorged-ly badged with the City Arms in gold, but no city arms
open to badger them with golden opinions; and, altogether, the
Aldermen pass so many bad things that PUNCHINELLO can afford to
let them pass like bad dimes, before they are nailed to the
counter of that Public Opinion to which they run counter.</p>

<hr>
<div align="center">
<p><b>Will the Aldermen Respond?</b></p>
</div>

<p>Do they who took up the SEWARD intend to perish by the
SEWARD?</p>

<p>[Footer: Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year
1870, by the PUNCHINELLO PUBLISHING COMPANY, in the Clerk's
Office of the District Court of the United States, for the
Southern District of New-York.]</p>

<hr>
<div align="center">
<h3>HINTS FOR THE FAMILY.</h3>
</div>

<p>Since the first publication of the hints to economically
disposed families, PUNCHINELLO has received a great number of
letters from all parts of the country, cordially indorsing his
course. One gentleman writes that he has already saved enough
money from the diminution in the cost of his wife's pins (in
consequence of her having adopted the plan of keeping them stuck
into a stuffed bag) to warrant him in subscribing to this paper
for a year. Many of the readers of our first number write us that
they now never take a meal except from a board, or a series of
boards, supported by legs, as PUNCHINELLO recommended. Highly
encouraged by this evidence of their usefulness, PUNCHINELLO
hastens to offer further advice of the same valuable
character.</p>

<p>It may have been frequently noticed that all families require
food at certain intervals, generally three times a day, and in
the case of children even oftener. The cost of providing this
food at the butcher, baker, and provision shops is necessarily
very great, and it is well, then, to understand how a very good
substitute for store-food may be prepared at home. In order to
make this preparation, procure from your grocer's a quantity of
flour&mdash;ordinary wheat flour&mdash;buying much or little, according to
the size of your family. This must then be placed in a tin-pan,
and mixed with water, salt, and yeast, according to taste. If the
mass is now placed by the fire, a singular phenomenon will be
observed, to which it will be well to draw the attention of the
whole family; old and young will witness it with equal surprise
and delight. The whole body of the soft mixture will gradually
rise and fill (and sometimes even overflow) the pan! When not in
view by the household, it will be well to cover the pan with a
cloth, on account of dust and roaches; but it must be observed
that a soft and warm <a href="pnv1n3_p4n1.gif"><img
src="pnv1n3_p4n1s.gif" alt="family cat" border="0" align="left"></a>
bedlike arrangement will thus be formed, and if the family cat
should choose to make it her resting-place, the mixture will not
rise.</p>

<p>After this substance is sufficiently light and spongy, it must
be taken out of the pan and worked up into portions weighing a
few pounds each. But it must <i>not be eaten</i> in this
condition, for it would be neither palatable nor wholesome. It
should be put in another pan and placed in the oven. Then (if
there be a fire in the stove or range) it will be soon hardened
and dried by the action of the heat, and will be fit to be
eaten&mdash;provided the foregoing conditions have been perfectly
understood. When brought to the table, it should be cut in slices
and spread with molasses, jelly, butter, or honey, and it will be
found quite adequate to the relief of ordinary hunger. A family
which has once used this preparation will never be content
without it. Some persons have it at every meal.</p>

<p>PUNCHINELLO has read with great pleasure a recently published
book, by CATHARINE BEECHER, and her sister Mrs. STOWE, the object
of which is to teach ingenious folks how to make ordinary
articles of household furniture in their leisure hours. One
article not mentioned by these ladies is recommended by
PUNCHINELLO to the attention of all economical families. It
having been observed that it is a highly useful practice to
provide for the regular recurrence of meals, bedtime and other
household epochs, an instrument which shall indicate the hour of
the day will be of the greatest advantage. Such a one may thus be
made on rainy days or in the long winter evenings. Procure some
thin boards and construct a small box. If it can be made pointed
at one end, with two little towers to it, so much the better.
Make a glass door to it, and paste upon the lower part of this a
picture representing a scene in Spanish Germany. Paint a rose
just under the scene. Then get a lot of brass cog-wheels, and put
them together inside of the box. Arrange them so that they shall
fit into each other and wrap a string around one of them, to the
end of which a lump of lead or iron should be attached. Then put
a piece of tin, with the hours painted thereon, on the upper part
of the box, behind the door, and get two long bits of thin iron,
one shorter than the other, and connect them, by means of a hole
in the middle of the tin, with the cog-wheels inside. Then shut
the door, and if this apparatus has been properly made, it will
tell the time of day. Any thing more convenient cannot be
imagined, and the cost of the brass, by the pound, will not be
more than fifteen cents, while the wood, the tin, and the iron
may be had for about ten cents. In the shops the completed
article would be very much more costly.</p>

<a href="pnv1n3_p4n2.gif"><img src="images/pnv1n3_p4n2s.gif" alt="clock"
border="0" align="left"></a>

<p>In his "Hints" PUNCHINELLO always desires to remember the
peculiar needs of the ladies, and will now tell them something
that he is sure will please them. They have all found, in the
course of their shopping, that it is exceedingly difficult to
procure at the dry goods stores, any sort of fabric which is so
woven as to fit the figure, and they must have frequently
experienced the necessity of cutting their purchases into
variously-shaped pieces and fastening them together again by
means of a thread. Here is an admirable plan for accomplishing
this object. Take a piece of fine steel wire and sharpen one end
of it. Now bore a hole in the other end, in which insert the
thread. If the edges of the cloth are now placed together, and
the wire is forced through them, the operator will find, to her
delight and surprise, that the thread will readily follow it. If
the wire is thus passed through the stuff, backward and forward,
a great many times, the edges will be firmly united. It will be
necessary, on the occasion of the first puncture, to form a hard
convolution at the free end of the thread, so as to prevent it
passing entirely through. This method will be found much more
convenient than the plan of punching holes in the stuff and then
sticking the ends of the thread through them. In the latter case,
the thread is almost certain to curl up, and cause great
annoyance.</p>

<h3>LATEST FROM WASHINGTON.</h3>
</div>

<p>Commissioner Piegan, of Montana, submits the outline of a
treaty with the Indians, which embraces the following provisions,
(the embracing of provisions being strictly in character:)</p>

<p>1. No infant under three months of age, and no old man over
one hundred and ten, to be killed by either party in battle.<br>
 All women to be killed on sight.<br>
 Where the small-pox is raging, the field to be left to the
Small-Pox.</p>

<p>2. Presents to Indians to consist chiefly of arms, ammunition,
and whisky.</p>

<p>3. Liquor-sellers and apostles to be encouraged on equal
terms.</p>

<p>4. Amateur sportsmen to be warned against killing Indians
during the breeding season.</p>

<p>5. Quakers and VINCENT COLLYER to be assigned to duty at
Washington.</p>

<p>6. Four months' notice to be given of any intended attack on a
White camp.</p>

<p>7. In scalping a lady, the rights of property in waterfall and
switch to be sacredly regarded.</p>

<p>8. Declarations of love (during a campaign) to be submitted in
writing.</p>

<p>9. The usual atrocities to be observed by both parties.</p>

<p>10. Hostilities to terminate when the last Indian lays down
his tomahawk, (to take a drink,) unless sooner shot by his white
brethren, or removed to a new reservation by the small-pox.</p>

<p>Action on this treaty is expected to take place in about ten
years.</p>

<h3>A DISTINGUISHED VISITOR.</h3>
</div>

<p>It is now settled that PIERRE BONAPARTE, who has been
sentenced by the High Court of Tours to leave France, is coming
to New-York with the intention of opening a pistol-gallery in
partnership with REDDY the Blacksmith. As the Prince is known to
have "polished off" at least four men with his revolver, his
reception by the occupants of "Murderer's Block" and other famous
localities of the city will doubtless be very enthusiastic. A
suite of apartments is now being fitted up for his accommodation
in East-Houston Street&mdash;The rooms are very tastefully decorated
with portraits of the late lamented BILLY MULLIGAN and other
celebrated knights of the trigger. The Prince, it is understood,
will drop his title on his arrival here, and enter society as
plain PETER BONAPARTE&mdash;thus Englishing PIERRE, because it is
French for stone, and he thinks that his exploits entitle him to
take rank in New-York as a Brick.</p>

<h3>A SOROSIAN IMPROMPTU.</h3>
</div>

<p>One of the sisters of Sorosis, at the last meeting of the
club, was delivered of the following touching "Impromptu on some
beautiful bouquets of flowers:"</p>

<blockquote>"With hungry eyes we glanced adown<br>
 The table nicely spread;<br>
 Our appetites were very keen,<br>
 And not one word was said,<br>
<br>
 "Till of a sudden "Ohs!" and "Ahs!"<br>
 Gave token of delight,<br>
 As, from a magic flower-bed.<br>
 Bright buds appeared in sight.<br>
<br>
 "May this sweet thought suggest the way<br>
 In which to spend life's hours;<br>
 And we endeavor every day<br>
 To scatter fragrant flowers."</blockquote>

<p>The first verse reminds us not a little of several olden
nursery rhymes of a prandial and convivial character, of which
the most prominent is that relating to little JACK HORNER, who
sat in a corner eating a Christmas pie. But even he is not
described as having "hungry eyes," though there is small doubt
but that he had a good appetite, and was "hungry o' the stomach."
It is pleasant to know that the table was nicely spread, though
not as "keen appetites" would have demanded, with bread and
butter; but, as the subject calls for, with flowers&mdash;food of a
very proper character for hungry eyes to feed upon. Nor is it any
wonder that those of the sisterhood who went to the table
expecting to find something more substantial than flowers set
before them, should at first sight have been unable to utter one
word. And only, after their first astonishment and disappointment
was over, the magical letters O's and R's, which, we may presume,
was a short way of calling for Old Rum, to restore their drooping
spirits, though our poetess, with a woman's perverseness, would
have us believe they were intended as "tokens of delight."</p>

<p>Of the last verse we can only say that it is an evident
plagiarism of the well-known juvenile poem, commencing,</p>

<blockquote>"How doth the little busy bee<br>
 Improve each shining hour,<br>
 And gather honey all the day<br>
 From every opening flower!"</blockquote>

<p>We confess, though, that we are unable to discover the "sweet
thought" that is to "suggest the way"</p>

<blockquote>"In which to spend life's hours!"</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, we believe it would be tiresome and monotonous to be
occupied "every day" in scattering "fragrant flowers," even if we
were certain that the lovely members of Sorosis would regard them
with "tokens of delight."</p>

<p>We regard this Impromptu as a failure, and call upon ALICE,
and PHEBE, and CELIA, and other tuneful members of the Sorosis
Club to come to the rescue of their unfortunate sister&mdash;the
perpetrator of the above verses.</p>

<h3>THE REAL ESTATE OF WOMAN.</h3>

<p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: We would not for the <i>World</i>&mdash;no, nor
even for PUNCHINELLO&mdash;cast any reproaches upon the vigorous
movement made in these latter days to find the real estate of
woman; but why, tell us why, should we find enlisted in this
cause at present, as members of the various <i>Sorosis-ters</i>,
so many single sisters with pretensions to youth?</p>

<a href="pnv1n3_p6n1.gif"><img src="images/pnv1n3_p6n1s.gif" alt=
"She searches for a man." border="0" align="right"></a>

<p>We have always looked upon the champions of woman's
righteousness, those who believe in the <i>fee-male absolute</i>
as the real estate of woman, as principally married women, whose
housekeeping has proved a failure, (except in the single item of
hot water,) and certain ladies who have lived to mature age
without reference to men, and whom no man would take even with
the best of reference.</p>

<p>There surely must be something wrong, somewhere, when those in
the younger walks of age take on this armor.</p>

<p>Where is the need?</p>

<p>Why should they who have never had their young lives blighted
by a husband linger pathetically over the tyranny of the sterner
sex?</p>

<p>Instead of shedding all these tears over other people's
husbands, they ought rather to rejoice that they have been spared
such inflictions in the past, and give exceeding great thanks
that they are beyond danger of such in the future.</p>

<p>There may be other young women (if I may so speak) who are so
heart-broken because of the oppression of their sex, as wives, so
disgusted with the state matrimonial under the present
constitution of society, that they would not marry&mdash;oh! no.</p>

<a href="pnv1n3_p6n2.gif"><img src="images/pnv1n3_p6n2s.gif" align=
"right" alt=
"She searches for a fire. 'There's somethin' a singein'!'"
border="0"></a>

<p>Now, we all remember the cogent reason why John refused to
partake of his evening repast, and we assure these young persons
that they have nothing whatever to fear. The danger is past, and
they are safe beyond the possibility of a peradventure.</p>

<p>They are not the kind that men devour. And yet we can not help
feeling pity for them; their experience has been <i>trying</i>,
but in vain; they know what it is "to suffer and be
strong"-minded; they have learned "to labor and to wait," and it
is well; for in all probability they will wait for some time.</p>

<p>It may be that the poor creatures are afflicted by the thought
that <i>perhaps</i> they may be called upon to make warning
examples of themselves, and marry; and that <i>perhaps</i> the
man they marry may be a tyrant, and&mdash;but the contingency is too
remote.</p>

<p>Some tell us that their youthful ardor is to uphold the
standard of woman's mission: they want to work.</p>

<p>Well, all we can say is&mdash;<i>go it</i>! for under the
circumstances, with no one to work for them, the best possible
thing they can do is to work for themselves. But couldn't they do
more, or at least as much, without so much noise? If they only
had plenty to do, and not so much spare time to talk about what
they are going to do, wouldn't they be better off, and poor frail
man be the gainer thereby?</p>

<p>If they could only resolve upon such a course, and stick to
it, don't you think they would receive more aid, material and
moral?</p>

<p>Many would gladly contribute of their substance in such a
cause, with overflowing hearts; and the world of man will gladly
guarantee to those who avow their determination not to marry,
entire immunity from any temptation in that direction.</p>

<p>As to the rest&mdash;those weak creatures who <i>will</i> be
satisfied with good husbands and broad home-missions&mdash;they know
no better; they will continue to move in their limited spheres,
benighted but happy, and every thing will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Lawyers tell us that since the statutes of 1848, a woman's
<i>real estate</i> has been within her own control; we take a
broader view: we think it <i>always</i> has been within her own
control by virtue of that old first statute given to our gentle
mother, EVE.</p>

<h3>AN OLD BAILEY PRACTITIONER.</h3>

<p>In England they have an institution called the Old Bailey. It
dealt from time immemorial in such queer animals as "four-footed
recognizances," and in such strong assistance to justice as
"straw bail" affords. The court-room of the Old Bailey may be
called a historical vat of crime. Until recently, New-York was
Old Bailey-less. Now detectives go about the streets singing an
air which reminds one forcibly of the tune called "Unfortunate
Miss BAILEY," only that it is Mister BAILEY they have missed. Old
BAILEY is really like JOHN GILPIN in two respects; all rumors
about him begin by calling him "a citizen of credit and renown;"
and they generally end by referring to him as a man who was gone
to "dine at&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>Our New-York Old BAILEY has disappeared. Either the FULLERTON
earthquake has swallowed him up, or he has gone to the unknown
land to which most Spiritual mediums migrate. There never was a
greater Spiritual medium than Old BAILEY. He has had spirits on
the brain during several years past. He throve on spirits. He had
only to rap on casks of spirits, and greenbacks would rustle
therefrom like trailing garments out of the Spirit-world. He had
assistant mediums in all the Federal officers. And now the
question asked of Commissioner DELANO, (who, by the way, in this
respect would gladly become DELA-yes) is "Canst thou call
'spirits from the vasty deep?' and if thou canst, where is Old
BAILEY?" Banker CLEWS is one of his sureties, but he owns no
Clews to his principal's whereabouts. Do not PUNCHINELLO'S
subjects all know that whisk brooms sweep clean, and that no
broom swept cleaner the Augean stables of Federal plunderers than
that wretched Old BAILEY'S whisky broom? There is, however, an
old proverb which claims that industrious brooms soon wear out.
But BAILEY is unlike a broom, in that no one can find a handle to
his whereabouts.</p>

<p>PUNCHINELLO has heard a great deal about the practice of the
Old Bailey in London. He thinks it likely that so long as the
Administration continues to protect Federal plunderers, and to
cover their tracks by attacks against alleged city and State
abuses, these Old Bailey practices recently introduced into the
United States Courts and United States procedure, within or
without revenue offices, must soon entitle a large number of
Federal officers, all over the country, to be happily styled "Old
Bailey Practitioners."</p>

<p>"TWEED 'l win."</p>

<p>"Tweedle-dee!" retorted SEWARD. "What d'ye mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean," rejoined THURLOW, that his name, T. WEED, is
identical with one that erstwhile loomed largest in the

<h3>PHILADELVINGS.</h3>

<p>"Mother! mother!" screamed a little girl from above stairs to
her maternal parent in the parlor. "Mother, I've been crying ever
so long, and HANNAH won't pacify me!" And now PUNCHINELLO notices
that it is not only little girls who act in this charming manner;
for the Hon. WILLIAM D. KELLEY, of Philadelphia, has just
screamed over the Congressional banisters that he must be
pacified, or he will no longer serve the good people of the
Fourth District of Pennsylvania. Therefore some fifteen hundred
of his constituents have written him a letter, and have said to
him, "Dat he sall, de poo itty-witty darling-warling, have his
placey-wacey as longey-wongey as he wants it, and the nasty-
wasty one-legged soldiers sha'n't trouble him for situations any
more, so they sha'n't." So the poor fellow straightens himself
up, ceases his sobbing, and consents to.be pacified and take his
three thousand a year for a little while longer. This may do very
well for once in a while; but the Honorable WILLIAM D. announces
that, not only does he desire to be pacified in regard to the
people who expect him to get them situations, but that he wants
to be with his family for more than six months in a year, and
that his property affairs are a little mixed. Now, what if he
should ask, next time, that his family shall be assigned
apartments in the Capitol, and that he shall be put on the Grant
Category, and be presented with an estate by his grateful
constituents? And suppose he should declare that he would serve
no more unless General LOGAN should be included among the number
of those from whose importunities he is to be defended? The good
Irish blood of WILLIAM D. has always boiled at the sound of the
slogan, for it generally means fight, and he wants&mdash;pacifying.
PUNCHINELLO respectfully presents his condolences to the people
of the Fourth District of Pennsylvania, and hopes that they will
have a happy time of it with WILLIAM D.</p>

<p>He has also noticed that the Philadelphians are having a
lively and brotherly dispute over their new public buildings;
they don't know where to put them. Most of the citizens are very
much opposed to doing any thing on the square; that is to say,
Independence Square, where the citizens assert their freedom by
treading down all the grass, and making a mud-flat of what was
intended to be a turfy lawn. Some folks want the buildings on
PENN Square&mdash;so called because it is split in the middle, and
answers its intended purposes only on paper. But the good Quakers
hate to interfere with the rights of the blacks, whether they be
men or women, and so many of the latter make this square their
abiding place every summer, that it would seem like a violation
of the spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment to disturb them. But
there is no doubt that the good Philadelphians will have their
new buildings some day, for they are very enterprising. Witness
the disposition of one of their leading men, "Slushy" SMITH by
name, who wants fifty thousand dollars with which to open an
avenue from the Delaware to Sixth street, basing his claims upon
the fact that such avenue will lead to Fairmount Park! Now, as
the nearest point of the park is two miles and a half from Sixth
street, the vigor of the scheme and the foreseeing character of
the projectors are worthy of a metropolis.</p>

<p>PUNCHINELLO is furthermore delighted to see that a son of PENN
has decided the great question of the Pope's infallibility, which
so vexes our OEcumenical fellow-creatures. POPE has been beheaded
at Harrisburg, and of course there is no further need to discuss
his infallibility. When a man loses his head, he is fallible. To
be sure, the case was only one of a picture of GRANT and his
Generals, which hung in the State Library, and in which POPE'S
head was painted out, and Governor GEARY'S substituted; but the
act shows, on the part of the adherents of the leaden-legged
governor, a head-strong determination to proceed to extremities
which has given rise to the gravest apprehensions; but
PUNCHINELLO hopes for the best. It is expected that the
Legislature will soon compel the inhabitants of the City of
Fraternites to send their children to school, whether they like
it or not. This is certainly progression, and PUNCHINELLO now
looks confidently forward to a law compelling all Philadelphians
to wash their pavements twice a day; to have white marble
front-steps (without railings) to all their houses; to build said
houses entirely of red brick, with green shutters; to make their
sidewalks of similar bricks, laid unevenly, to agitate passers-by
and so prevent dyspepsia, and that each house shall have at least
one little gutter running over its pavement.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A FRIEND.</h3>
</div>

<p>FRIEND PUNCHINELLO:</p>

<p>Thee is right welcome; but thee should look upon this as a
city of Friends, and not place it in thy wicked pages, but rather
in thy Good Books&mdash;all the more since thee claims to exalt the
good things pertaining to pen and pencil, and this is the great
City of Penn and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>If thee should come this way next summer, to ruralize, thee
might behold our swollen Schuylkill, and say, Enough! Thee might
see our City Fathers, and say, Good! Doubtless thee has heard of
our butter? Well, thee might then taste it, and also say,
Good!&mdash;if thee likes. It is cheap. Thee will understand me,
friend, that it is cheap to say "Good" and good to say
"Cheap."</p>

<p>If thee will but talk "plain language," thee may circulate
freely in our streets, and behold our horses and dogs rubbing
noses against the fountains; nay, refreshing themselves thereat
by the sight and sound of little water!</p>

<p>Cruelty to Animals is Prevented&mdash;but thee knows this; for has
thee not thy BERGH? Thee does with <i>one</i> BERGH, but we have
two&mdash;Pittsburg and Harrisburg&mdash;and, moreover, a proverb which
says, "Every man thinketh his own goose a SWANN" If thee needs,
we can spare thee Harrisburg, and trust to the laws of
Providence.</p>

<p>But, friend PUNCHINELLO, if thee comes here, thee must be
careful what thee does. If thee does <i>nothing</i>, thee may be
restrained. Thrift accords not with idleness.</p>

<p>We permit none but official corner loungers and "dead beats;"
and, having a very FOX for a Mayor&mdash;whose police are sharp as
steel traps&mdash;thee comes into danger, unless thee be a Repeater.
True, thee might disguise thyself in liquor and&mdash;as friend Fox
taketh none&mdash;escape.</p>

<p>This epistle is written out of kindly regard for thee, and
because the Spirit moveth me to wish thee well and a long life;
although thee may not live long enough to behold our new Public
Buildings, the site of which no man living can foresee.</p>

<h3>THE UMBRELLA.</h3>

(CONCLUDED.)</div>

<p>It has been suggested that should a select party from the
Fee-jee Islands, who never before had wandered from their own
delightful home, be thrown into London, they might immediately
erect the copper-colored flag, or whatever their national ensign
might be, and take possession of that populous locality by right
of discovery. So, in like manner, should you leave your umbrella
where it would be likely to be discovered&mdash;say in a restaurant,
or even in your own hall&mdash;the fortunate and enterprising explorer
who should happen to discover it would have in his favor the nine
points of the law that come with possession, and the remaining
points by right of discovery&mdash;a good thing for dealers in
umbrellas, but bad for that small portion of the general public
not addicted to petty larceny.</p>

<p>DICKENS, in one of his Christmas stories, tells us of an
umbrella that a man tried to get rid of: he gave it away; he sold
it; he lost it; but it invariably came back; despite his moat
strenuous exertions, like bad <i>incubi</i>, it remained upon his
hands.</p>

<p>This strange incident does not come within our present
treatise; it is of the supernatural, and we are seeking to write
the natural history of the umbrella.</p>

<p>The man who, has an umbrella that has grown old in his service
is a curiosity&mdash;so is the umbrella. If a man borrow an umbrella,
it is not expected that he will ever return it; he is a polite
and refined mendicant. If a man lend an umbrella, it is
understood that he has no further use for it; he is a generous
donor whose right hand knows not what his left hand
doeth&mdash;neither does his left hand.</p>

<p>A reform with regard to umbrellas has lately been attempted. A
very expressive and ingenious stand has been patented, in which
if an umbrella be once impaled there is no chance of its
abduction except by the hands of its rightful owner. A friend of
ours, who owned such a one, placed all his umbrellas in its
charge, and went his way joyfully with the keys in his pocket.
During his absence, a facetious burglar called and removed
umbrellas, stand, and all. Our friend concludes that it is
cheaper to lend umbrellas by retail.</p>

<p>Despite the apparent severity of these remarks, there may be
much romance connected with the umbrella. Many a young man
immersed in love has blessed the umbrella that it has been his
privilege to carry over the head of a certain young lady caught
in a shower. In such a case the umbrella may be the means of
cementing hearts. Two young hearts bound together by an
umbrella&mdash;think of it, ye dealers in poetical rhapsodies, and
grieve that the discovery was not yours!</p>

<p>How many agreeable chats have taken place beneath the
umbrella! how many a <i>confessio amantis</i> has ascended with
sweet savor into the dome of the umbrella and consecrated it for
ever!</p>

<p>The romance alluded to may be spoiled if there be great
disparity in height. If the lady be very tall and you be very
short, (so that you can't afford to ride in an omnibus,) you will
be apt to spoil a new hat; and if, on the other hand, the lady be
very short and you be very tall, you will probably ruin a spring
bonnet and break off the match.</p>

<p>Again, if you should happen to carry an umbrella of the vast
blue style&mdash;to your own disgust and the amusement of the
multitude&mdash;and, under such circumstances, you meet a particular
lady friend, your best course will be to pass rapidly by,
screening yourself from observation as much as possible.</p>

<p>It would also be awkward should the day be windy, and, as you
advance with a winning smile to offer an asylum to the
<i>stricken dear,</i> the umbrella should blow inside out.</p>

<p>The poet has raised the umbrella still higher by making it the
symbol of the marriage tie. He says,</p>

<blockquote>"Just as to a big umbrella<br>
 Is the handle when 'tis raining.<br>
 So unto a man is woman.<br>
 Though, the handle bears the burden,<br>
 'Tis the top keeps all the rain off;<br>
 Though the top gets all the wetting,<br>
 'Tis the handle still supports it.<br>
 So the top is good for nothing<br>
 If there isn't any handle;<br>
 And the case holds <i>vice versa</i>."</blockquote>

<p>All will appreciate the delicate pathos of the simile.
Speaking of similes reminds us that there is one on Broadway. An
enterprising merchant has for his sign an American eagle carrying
an umbrella.</p>

<p>Imagine the American eagle carrying an umbrella! As well
imagine JULIUS C&aelig;SAR in shooting-jacket and NAPOLEON-boots.
The sign was put up in war times, and was, of course, intended as
a Sign of the times, squalls being prevalent and umbrellas
needed. Now that the squalls are over, let us hope that the
umbrella may speedily come down. Just here we close ours.</p>

border="0" align="left"></a> o-day I'm sixty-nine&mdash;an Old Boy.
But, bless you! I was three times as old&mdash;I thought so then&mdash;when
I entered on my nineteenth year. I tell you, boys&mdash;but perhaps
you know it already&mdash;that the oldest figure we ever reach in this
world, the point at which we can look over the head of METHUSELAH
as easy as you can squint at the pretty girls, is at eighteen and
nineteen. Every body else around about that time amounts to
little, and less, and nothing at all. What's the "old man"&mdash;your
father, at forty-five&mdash;but an old fogy who doesn't understand
things at all? Of course not; how could he be expected to? He
didn't have the modern advantages. He didn't go to school at
five, the dancing academy at seven; nor did he give stunning
birthday parties at nine&mdash;not he. He didn't wear Paris kid-gloves
in the nursery, learn to swear at the tailor at ten, smoke and
"swell" at twelve, and flirt at Long Branch, Newport, or Saratoga
at thirteen. The truth is&mdash;you think so&mdash;the Old Man was brought
up "slow." And, to tell the truth, you had much rather not be
seen with him outside the house.</p>

<p>You are "one of the boys" now. I was, fifty years since. A
long time ago, that; but I've lived long enough to see and know
that I was a great fool then. You'll come to that, if you don't
run to seed before. I see now that what I then thought was
smartness, was mere smoke; and it was a great deal of smoke with
the smallest quantity of fire. The people I thought amounted to
nothing, and whom I symbolized with a cipher, were merely
reflections of my own small, addled brain. I, too, thought the
old man slow, <i>pass&eacute;</i>, stupid. I took him for a muff.
He must have known I was twice that. What does one of the boys at
nineteen care for advice? <i>I</i> didn't&mdash;<i>you</i> don't. It
went in at the right ear and out over the left shoulder. Old gent
said he'd been there; I said I was going. I did go. So did his
money. My talent&mdash;if that's what you call it&mdash;was centrifugal,
not centripetal. I was a radical out-and-outer, as to funds. I
made lots of friends&mdash;you should have seen them. They swarmed&mdash;
when there was any thing in my pocket. They left me alone in
solitude at other times. At twenty-nine I got pretty well along
in life. But I find I did not know so much as at nineteen. I had
seen something of the world, and also something of myself. The
more I saw and studied the latter individual, the less I thought
of him. I began sincerely to believe he was a humbug. At
thirty-nine, I knew he was; or rather had been. By that time he
had begun to mend&mdash;had he? He had married, and there was call for
mending, equally as to ways, means, and garments. From that hour
I cultivated in different fields. My wild oats were all
<i>raked</i> in. I was getting away from nineteen very
rapidly&mdash;happily receding from the boy of <i>that</i> period.
Mrs. BROWNGREEN beheld a man devoted to domestics and the
dailies. The clubs I left behind me&mdash;twice a week. I was at home
early&mdash;in the morning. I kept careful watch of my goings and
comings&mdash;so did my curious neighbors. I had my family around me&mdash;
also sheriffs and trades-people. I stood tolerably well in the
community; for I was straight in those times even when in
straits. But there was one stand I never did like to
take&mdash;anywhere in sight of my tailors. They were ungrateful. I
<i>gave</i> them any amount of patronage, and they turned on me
and wanted me to pay for it. That's the way of the world. It
wants much, and it wants it long; and when its bills come in, it
is found to be the latter dimensions with an emphasis.</p>

<p>Well, boys, when you get out of the nineteens, you will begin
to learn something. First of all, that you don't know much of any
thing. That's the beginning of wisdom, though twenty is pretty
well on to begin at a good school. You will learn that frogs are
not so large as elephants, and that a gas-bag is sure to end in a
collapse. You will learn that the greatest fool is he who thinks
he sees such in everybody else. You will learn that all women are
<i>not</i> angels, nor all people older than yourself "old
fogies." You will see that humanity&mdash;or its best type&mdash;is not
made of equal parts of assurance, twenty-five cent cigars, Otard
punches, swallow-tail coats, and flash jewelry; and that the
chances, in the proportion of nine to one, are that "one of the
boys" at nineteen is one of the noodlest of noodles.</p>

<h3>THE INDIAN.</h3>
</div>

<p>Indians were the first inhabitants of this country. "Lo!" was
the first, only, and original aboriginal. His statue may be seen
outside of almost any cigar-store. His descendants are still
called "Low," though often over six feet in height. The Indian is
generally red, but in time of war he becomes a "yeller." He lives
in the forest, and is often "up a tree." Indians believe in
ghosts, and when the Spirit moves them, they move the Spirits.
(N.B. They have no excise law.) They have an objection to crooked
paths, preferring to take every thing "straight." Although fond
of rum, they do not possess the Spirit of the old Rum-uns. They
are deficient in all metals except brass. This they have in large
quantities. The Indian is very benevolent; and believing that
"uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," he often scalps his
friends to allow them to sleep better. This is touching in the
extreme. He is also very hospitable, often treating his captives
to a hot Stake. This is also touching&mdash;especially to the captive.
He is very ingenious in inventing new modes of locomotion. Riding
on a rail is one of these. This is done after dinner, in order to
aid the digestion, although they often "settle your hash" in a
different way. Indians are independent, and can "paddle their own
canoes." It is very picturesque to see an Indian, who is a little
elevated, in a Tight canoe when the water is High. (No allusion
to LONGFELLOW'S "Higherwater" is intended.) Indians are pretty
good shots, often shooting rapids. Their aim is correct; but as
Miss CAPULET observes, "What's in an aim?" (Answer in our next.)
They are also skilful with the long-bow. This does not, however,
indicate that they take an arrow view of things. Not at all.
Sometimes, when reduced by famine, they live on arrow-root.
Sometimes they dip the points of their arrows in perfume, after
which they (the arrows, not the Indians) are Scent. That this
fact was known to Mr. SHAKESPEARE is shown by his line,</p>

<div align="center">"Arrows by any other name would smell as
wheat."</div>

<p>What is meant by the allusion to wheat is not quite clear; but
it probably refers to old Rye. An Indian may be called the Bow
ideal of a man. And then, again, he may not. It is a bad habit to
call names. The Western people have given up the Bow, but still
retain the Bowie. "Hang up the fiddle and the bow," (BYRON.)
Perhaps it is arrowing to their feelings. Perhaps it is not. The
Indian is different from the Girl of the Period. He has "two
strings to his bow," while she has two beaux "on a string."</p>

<h3>CAUSE AND EFFECT.</h3>
</div>

<p>When the <i>Daily Trombone</i> warns the POPE of Rome that his
course is prejudicial to the interests of true Catholics, the
venerable prelate doubtless adopts a new policy forthwith. When
the <i>Evening Slasher</i> informs NAPOLEON that unless he
conciliates the people of France his dynasty will be overthrown,
the Emperor doubtless at once confers with his Minister of State
concerning the advice thus proffered. When the <i>Morning
Pontoon</i> warns VICTORIA that her persistent seclusion is
damaging to the cause of the throne, Her Gracious Majesty,
without doubt, changes her habits of life instanter. When the
<i>Sunday Blowpipe</i> sagely informs BISMARCK that he is a
blunderer, the great diplomatist is probably thrown into
convulsions by the appalling intelligence. When the <i>Weekly
Gasmeter</i> coolly accuses the Czar of Russia of insincerity and
double-dealing, that potentate doubtless writes a private note to
the editor, defending his honor and policy. When the
<i>Gridiron</i> advises VICTOR EMMANUEL to be less rigid in his
diplomacy, or he will regret it, beyond question V.E., alarmed
and chagrined, reverses his policy in accordance with the advice
tendered. When the <i>Daily Pumpkin</i> informs GRANT that the
people are disappointed in him, he simply smokes.</p>

Churchman.</p>

<p>Well, said he, a High Churchman is a&mdash;&mdash;Well, he is a&mdash;&mdash;Well,
I should say he was a&mdash;&mdash;Well, hang me, he is a&mdash;&mdash;a High Old
Pharisee.</p>

We next inquired of a High Churchman what made a brother Low
Churchman?

<p>Well, he is a&mdash;&mdash;Well, I say he is a&mdash;&mdash;Well, some people call
him a&mdash;&mdash;Yes, he is a&mdash;&mdash;Well, he is a darned Low Pharisee.</p>

satisfactory to all interested, as they are to us.</p>

Senate is not a faster, though Senator SUMMER'S tongue goes
faster than any body else's in it; nor yet a prayer, though
Senator YATES is undeniably Prairie in his oratory; but it is a
humiliation. As Lord ASHBURNHAM well remarked when he saw it in
its fresh hey-day, we may repeat in its old salt-hay-day, "'Pon

lunatics about without making it too weakly. In the language of
Bishop POTTER, when asked by the Rev. Dr. DIX what he would do in
the event of a heart turning up, "I'll pass" to&mdash;</p>

<div align="center">THE HOUSE,</div>

<p>which never fails to amuse and instruct. Mr. COX has been
making a shocking speech about the tariff. Mr. COX remarked that
he once thought there was nothing like it. But I have been
travelling about since, he said, with a summer-mote in my own
buck eye in search of Winter Sunbeams in my Corsican brother's. I
have been in Corsica, and of Corsican find a parallel of the
latitude of this tariff in the leg ends of the robbers, by which
I do not mean the ankles of the Forty Thieves, whom I had the
pleasure of seeing in company with my "constituents of the Sixth
Congressional District of the City of New-York. " Well, then,
there was a robber in Corsica of the name of PELEG HIGGINS, who
found that his business in the Robbin Rednest line was suffering
from the opposition of several other robbers in the neighbor and
robbin' hood, who "went through" his victims, to use an
expressive phrase common among my constituents, before he had his
chance. PELEG thereupon went to the priest of the parish, who
assessed the sins of the robbers of that vicinity, and offered
him half the proceeds of his future crimes if he would increase
his tariff of penances on the opposition firms. The priest drew
up a schedule of the Whole Duties of Man. It was practically
prohibitory on murders, and robberies were assessed from sixty to
eighty per cent <i>ad valorem</i>. The other robbers
remonstrated. The priest said he would protect his parishioners.
PELEG is now very much respected, and owns an iron and log
rolling establishment. The other robbers were driven out of the
business. That, Mr. COX said, was the origin of the Protective
Tariff.</p>

<p>Mr. KELLEY wished to know how much British Gold Mr. COX had
received for his infamous harangue. As for him, he was bound to
protect his constituents (Mr. COX, "Parishioners;" and laughter
on the Democratic, or other, side of Mr. KELLEY'S mouth.) As to
the charge that he was behind the age, it was absurd. Every
Philadelphian knew that nobody could be behind the Age. He
advocated the principle expressed by the Pennsylvanian bard,</p>

<blockquote>You tickle me and<br>
 I'll tickle you.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. LOGAN said the army ought to be reduced; and he treated
with scorn General SHERMAN'S intimation that it ought not to be
reduced. General SHERMAN had once told him that there was a
Major-General whom the army could spare. He (LOGAN) was a
Major-General at the time. He did not know whom General SHERMAN
meant. He did not see the use of the regular army, or of
West-Point. In his State a man could get along just as well
without knowing any thing; and what was the sense of teaching
officers? The more they knew, the more they wanted to know. Give
them an inch, and they would take an ell. He didn't know what an
ell an ell was, and he didn't want to. He was willing to provide
a staff, but not a crutch.</p>

<p>Mr. SLOCUM said he hoped it was not unparliamentary to observe
that the gentleman who preceded him didn't know what he was
talking about. The French staff is larger than our staff. So is
the British United Service Club. So is the Irish shillelagh. If
the reductions proposed were carried "out," the staff would stick
at nothing. The arms of the service might get on without a staff,
but how about the legs.</p>

<div align="center"><b>Allurements of the Period.</b></div>

<p>Novelty and nakedness are the elements to which modern
managers of plays and shows chiefly look for success. A new song,
the name if which it is unnecessary to give, has brought fresh
fame and renewed fortune to the proprietors of a celebrated
minstrel theatre. Legs have contributed their might to fill the
coffers of some of our leading theatrical managers&mdash;legs of the
feminine gender, with much display about them, but no drapery.
Thus it will be seen that New Ditty in the one case, and Nudity
in the other, have taken the great public by the forelock and led
it to where the minstrels gesticulate, and the legs and
footlights quiver. And now the "lower animals" are touched by the
whim of the period, a leading attraction on the bills of the
Circus being an equestrian performance with "four naked
horses."</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO "SHERIDAN'S RIDE."</h3>
</div>

<div align="right">PHILADELPHIA, March 26, 1870.</div>

DEAR PUNCHINELLO:

<p>Taking my way along Chestnut Street a few days since, I found
my progress arrested at Tenth Street by a great current of
humanity, that swept with resistless force into the entrance to
the Academy of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>I, too, entered, and, passing around the familiar group of the
"Centaurs and Lapith&aelig;," which stands beneath the dome, was
hurried breathlessly onward by the throng, until I found myself
face to face with that <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of modern art, T.
BUCHANAN READ'S painting of "SHERIDAN'S Ride."</p>

<p>Give the reins to your imagination, now, (a little horse-talk
is appropriate here,) and behold one thousand men and women, of
refined and cultivated tastes, doing tearful homage to the genius
of the great Poetaster&mdash;pardon me, Mr. T.B.R., Poet-artist was
what I meant to have said.</p>

<p>From these my critical orbs now wandered to the painting; from
the painting to PUGH, (the astute "engineer" of the "show,") and
then to the painting again. "What drawing!" remarked I. (PUGH
smiled, and glanced approvingly at the audience.) "There is much
freedom and boldness in it," continued I. "It is very broad, rich
in color, and&mdash;" "In a word," interrupted a friend of mine, whose
grandfather was a Frenchman, "full of <i>chic</i>!" (PUGH
blushed.)</p>

<p>Admirable and truthful, indeed, is the expression imparted by
the artist to the fleet General who suddenly became famous by
being Twenty Miles away from the Post of Duty!</p>

<p>The flashing eye; the close-cut military style of the hair;
the fierce moustache; the row of three buttons marking exalted
grade; the vigorous yet graceful movement of the sword-arm, and
the cap disappearing in the distance, indicative of the
remarkable time making by the "horsenman"&mdash;all these are
admirable points in the picture, and worthy of being closely
studied by the student of Art.</p>

<p>As I gazed, a shock-headed young man, with a very red nose,
whom I at once recognized as a student of the Life Class,
sneeringly observed that the "flourish of the sword smelt a
little of the foot-lights." (Artists are ever jealous.)</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the clever painter of "SHERIDAN'S Ride"
has meaning in the flourish of the sabre. It indicates that his
fleet hero uses the weapon, not to "fright the souls of fearful
adversaries," but to accelerate with frequent whacks the speed of
his heroic charger. The horse has observable points, too, and
especially one that might be called by the superficial critic
"faulty drawing." I refer to the extraordinary
fore-shortening&mdash;if the expression is in this case allowable&mdash;of
that part of the animal which extends from the saddle backward.
In this, again, there is a touch of nature that genius only can
impart. For what is more conceivable than that the hinder parts
of the heroic steed might have been cut away by an unlucky slash
with the edge of the sabre? There is precedent for this. Every
schoolboy can recall a similar accident which befell the horse of
MUNCHAUSEN as he dashed beneath the descending portcullis. And,
as from that famous steed's hind-quarters there sprang an
arborescent shelter, so, also, as a result of SHERIDAN'S "scrub
race," do laurels shade that hero's brows.</p>

<p>My views of the cause of this fore-shortening are enforced
when I state that there is a fine atmospheric effect about the
horse's tail, which seems to indicate that it was considerably in
the rear.</p>

<p>There can be no greater tribute to the powers of the artist,
or the worth of the heroic "horsenman," than the crowds which
daily, in these heretofore silent and hallowed precincts, "wake
the echoes with sounds of praise."</p>

<p>Yonder is "Death on the Pale Horse." As I gazed, Death smiled
with approval at "SHERIDAN'S Ride," and the stony figure of
GERMANICUS "leant upon his sword and wiped away a tear."...</p>

<p>Suddenly a pistol-shot rang through the vaulted aisles, and,
amid the shouts of men and shrieks of affrighted women, I
ascertained that a daring rebel, (one EARLY,) moved by the
wondrous fidelity of the picture, had drawn a revolver, and fired
at the "counterfeit presentment" of the man who had humbled him
at Winchester.</p>

<p>Amid the confusion, a manly voice shouted, "Three cheers for
the Hero of Winchester!"</p>

<p>"That's Wright!" yelled the shock-headed young man with the
red nose....</p>

<p>Then I left the scene, pondering as I went, "What manner of
painter is this, who can so deftly limn the features of a hero as
to draw tears from his worshippers and bullets from his foes?"
And, as I pondered, that abstruse conundrum of CHURCH, the
artist, came to my mind: "What if, after all, READ, your brush
should steal the laurels from your pen?"</p>

<p>"What," indeed?</p>

<h3>"PLEASE THE PIGS."</h3>

<p>Foreign Pig, we observe, furnishes a topic just now for
writers in the daily papers. IRON-ically speaking, pig, in the
sense referred to, means a lump of metal; but the <i>World</i> of
March 26th has an accidental, though none the less curious,
"cross-reading," which brings foreign pig directly into contact
with domestic. It says, (the <i>World</i>, not the pig.)</p>

<p>    "Protected foreign pig in New-York, $32."</p>

<p>Precisely on a line with this, in the next column, appears the
following.</p>

<p>    "What between hogs and policemen, drunken women are being
rapidly exterminated in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>The <i>World's</i> cross-reading is a capital one, bringing
the pigs together nicely, and suggesting the following
remarks:</p>

<p>    "Protected foreign pig in New-York, $32," very aptly
applies to the gangs of imported burglars and ruffians of all
sorts who run riot in our midst, and who can generally insure the
"protection" of the police by a <i>douceur</i> so paltry even as
$32.</p>

<p>Such hybrids as Philadelphia drunken women, "between hogs and
policemen," must be extremely disagreeable objects, and we are
glad to learn that they are nearly extinct. Here we are much
worse off. Rowdy characters, that may well be compared to "hogs,"
but are not often to be seen "between policemen," are far too
plentiful in New-York, and the sooner they are "exterminated" the
better.</p>

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
